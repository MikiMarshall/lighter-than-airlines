# lighter-than-airlines

A "light"-hearted travel reservation site for risk-averse travelers.

## Description

A midterm project for my Javascript class, simulating a travel 
reservation system.

The page employs Javascript, CSS, drop-down selections, 
dynamic calculations, a pop-up response to the reservation
submission, an old-fashioned theme, historical images and a 
little tongue-in-cheek hydrogen humor.
