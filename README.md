# lighter-than-airlines
A travel reservation site for risk-averse travelers.

## Description
A midterm project for my Javascript class, simulating a travel 
reservation system (I seem to be enamored with travel here). 
The page employs Javascript, CSS, drop-down selections, 
dynamic calculations, a pop-up response to the reservation
submission, an old-fashioned theme, historical images and a 
little tongue-in-cheek hydrogen humor.

## Known issues
- No blimps were harmed in the making of this site.
